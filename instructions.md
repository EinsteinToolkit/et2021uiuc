# Instructions

## Connecting
The school will be completely virtual with sessions hosted via the University
of Illinois' Zoom subscription. In order to join, you will need to log into
your Zoom account (any account, it does not have to be associated with a
University) and there will be a waiting room. A live video stream of the
meeting will be available on YouTube once the meeting starts. Please note that
some sessions will be recorded.

We will use Gitter as a chat solution for chats that persist across Zoom
sessions. You will need a GitHub, GitLab or Twitter account to be able to post
messages but can read without logging in. The chat, in addition to the website,
will be used to disseminate information during the workshop, such as schedule
changes, breaks and YouTube channel URLs.

Each day before and after the actual school there will be a 30 minutes "help
session" for the tutorials and also general discussions.

Gitter chat:

The Zoom meeting opens at 7:45AM CDT each day, the school program starts at
8:25AM CDT. Zoom login information is provided in the information package sent
to each registered participant.
