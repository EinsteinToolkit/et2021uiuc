We are pleased to announce the 2021 edition of the North American
Einstein Toolkit Workshop. The Workshop to be held at the University of
Illinois will provide an opportunity for researchers and students to
learn about the [Einstein Toolkit](https://einsteintoolkit.org/), a
community-driven software platform of core computational tools to advance
and support research in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational
physics.

The workshop will offer a mixture of talks and tutorials, with the
tutorials including basic tutorials for new users and more advanced
topics. The talks will, likewise, provide information for new users and
will highlight exciting science cases and the latest developments in
numerical relativity. On the final day, we will discuss future directions
and development
