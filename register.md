# Register for the 2021 virtual Einstein Toolkit school

The Einstein Toolkit school is offered free of charge, with no fees of any kind
charged. To keep count of the expected number of attendees and to avoid
Zoom-bombing incidents we ask that you register using this [Google
Form](https://forms.gle/kJEz8ERtDVpWJ7Fi6). Please note that deadline to apply
for a short talk has passed.

Once your application has been approved by the organizers, you will be sent a
confirmation email and login instructions for the Zoom meeting. Please allow
for at least **3 business** days for processing.

Before registering, please read the [code of conduct](codeofconduct.html).

If you have any questions, please contact the organizers at
[workshop@einsteintoolkit.org](mailto:workshop@einsteintoolkit.org).
