# Register for the 2021 virtual Einstein Toolkit school

The Einstein Toolkit school is offered free of charge, with no fees of any kind
charged. To keep count of the expected number of attendees and to avoid
Zoom-bombing incidents we ask that you register using this [Google
Form](https://forms.gle/kJEz8ERtDVpWJ7Fi6). During the registration process you can also
request time for a short presentation of your own scientific results. We
anticipate to be able to offer the opportunity for short talks in the
[lightning talk sections](program.html).

Once your application has been approved by the organizers, you will be sent a
confirmation email and login instructions for the Zoom meeting. Please allow
for at least **3 business** days for processing.

<b>Note:</b> While participating on the school you will agree to the participant's [code of conduct](codeofconduct.html).

If you have any questions, please contact the organizers at
[workshop@einsteintoolkit.org](mailto:workshop@einsteintoolkit.org).
