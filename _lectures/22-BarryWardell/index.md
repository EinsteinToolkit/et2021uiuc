The [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](https://bhptoolkit.org) brings together software and data relating to black hole perturbation theory. These can then be used to model gravitational radiation from small mass ratio binaries as well as from the ringdown of black holes. The former are key sources for the future space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA.

In this lecture we will learn about the various components of the toolkit and how they can be used to produce an adiabatic waveform model for extreme mass ratio inspirals.
