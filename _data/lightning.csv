AaronHeld,Aaron Held,Imperial College London,Nonlinear Dynamics of Quadratic Gravity,"I will present results on the first numerically stable nonlinear evolution for the leading-order gravitational effective field theory (Quadratic Gravity) in the spherically symmetric sector. The respective simulations (obtained in collaboration with Hyun Lim) provide numerical evidence for a well-posed initial-value formulation. As this provides a proof-of-principle for the possibility of stable numerical evolution in the presence of higher derivatives, I will also comment on the status of full 3+1 simulations in Quadratic Gravity."
AlexVanoVinuales,Alex Vano-Vinuales,"CENTRA, IST, University of Lisbon",Hyperboloidal wave equation in 3D,"Reaching future null infinity in numerical relativity simulations is of utmost importance, as it is the only location in spacetime where gravitational ratiation is unambiguously defined. It can be achieved by evolving on hyperboloidal slices, which are smooth spacelike slices that asymptote to null rays and reach null infinity. In the present approach, conformal compactification methods are used to tackle the problem and a stable hyperboloidal code that solves the Einstein equations in spherical symmetry for regular and strong field initial data has been successfully developped. On the way towards extending these results to three spatial dimensions, first the massless scalar field is considered as a toy model. I will describe the current results of evolving the hyperboloidal wave equation in 3D in the NRPy+ code, as well as report on the status of the equivalent implementation within the Einstein Toolkit framework.

AlexandraWernersson,Alexandra Wernersson,Utrecht University,Ultralight bosons around black holes with numerical relativity,"Ultralight bosons are a prominent type of axion-like dark matter. These particles may form clouds around black holes through the superradiance process. In this talk I will discuss the first non-perturbative exploration of ultralight bosons around black holes with numerical relativity. I will explain the numerical setup using the Kadath code, a successor of LORENE, and if time allows I will discuss the results of the non-perturbative field profile as well as new physical effects such as self-interaction and backreaction of the cloud."
AlexandruDima,Alexandru Dima,SISSA,Neutron star simulations in screened modified gravity,"Screening mechanisms in modified gravity are devised to suppress
deviations from General Relativity in typical astrophysical scenarios,
allowing these theories to avoid constraints coming from weak field
observations.
However, only few work has been done to explore the validity of
screening mechanisms in extreme regimes, such as in the interior of neutron stars.
In this talk I will briefly present results from numerical simulations
of chameleon-(un)screened neutron stars and discuss the strong
signatures allowed when the screening mechanism fails."
AtulKedia,Atul Kedia,University of Notre Dame,Binary neutron star mergers of quark matter based nuclear equations of state,"With recent observations of gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star(BNS) mergers and observations by NICER, the nuclear equation of state(EoS) is becoming increasingly testable by numerical simulations. Numerous simulations currently exist exploring the equations of state at different density regimes for the constituent neutron stars. In this work we perform full GR three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of BNS mergers for parameterized EoSs based on quark matter at the highest nuclear densities. We construct our initial data using Lorene followed by simulating the merger with Einstein Toolkit. The goal of this study is to extract the effects on the observed GW waveform as the merger happens caused by quark matter. "
DhruvDesai,Dhruv Desai,Columbia University,Neutron Star wind simulations,"I will present results of neutrino-driven winds using an M0 scheme for neutrino transport and a tabulated EOS. I will compare wind results (mass flow rate, composition, entropy) for a non-rotating and rigidly-rotating case. I will briefly discuss implications for heavy element synthesis via r-process."
HayleyMacpherson,Hayley Macpherson,University of Cambridge,FLRWSolver: realistic cosmological initial conditions for the Einstein Toolkit,"We are well and truly entering the era of precision cosmology, with upcoming surveys expected to map hundreds of thousands of supernovae to percent-level precision. The majority of our cosmological modelling relies on the assumption that Newtonian dynamics atop an exact homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime is sufficient to describe the late Universe. Investigations into general-relativistic effects on cosmological data have shown they could be important for near-future surveys. I will describe our publicly-available thorn FLRWSolver, written to provide realistic cosmological initial conditions for the Einstein Toolkit. This thorn has been shown to be reliable in studying late-Universe dynamics in numerical relativity, and is a useful tool to address some important questions regarding the validity of current assumptions in cosmology.

JayVijayKalinani,Jay Vijay Kalinani,"University of Padova, Italy",A new primitive variable recovery scheme in GRMHD code Spritz,"General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations are an indispensable tool to obtain a detailed physical understanding of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Flux-preserving GRMHD codes numerically evolve a set of conservative equations based on ‘conserved’ variables which then need to be converted back to the ‘primitive’ physical variables. The corresponding conservative-to- primitive (c2p) recovery procedure is a crucial aspect at the core of any GRMHD code. In this talk, I will discuss a completely new c2p recovery scheme for ideal MHD. Using both stand-alone tests and by performing demanding three-dimensional GRMHD tests, we have demonstrated robustness, accuracy, and efficiency over the whole relevant parameter space. This includes the critical case of very strong magnetizations. I will also talk about technical aspects of implementing the scheme in our new GRMHD code Spritz, such as the requirements for the EOS framework."
MostafizurRahman,Mostafizur Rahman,"Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar",Ringdown of compact objects,"In recent years, several horizonless compact object models were proposed to address the problems associated with the existence of black holes. As the gravitational wave detectors started to observe more and more merger events with a large signal-to-noise ratio, gravitational wave spectroscopy could hold the key to uncover the existence of these objects. This is because the late time ringdown signals of horizonless compact objects differ from that of the black holes. In this talk, I will discuss the ringdown properties of compact objects and compare them with those obtained in the black hole scenario. Since the internal structure and the equation of state of these compact objects are largely unknown, we employ the membrane paradigm to obtain appropriate boundary conditions for the perturbations of these objects. This model can describe the ringdown properties of a large variety of compact objects."
PedroIldefonso,Pedro Ildefonso,"Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon",Binary systems of boson stars,"Gravitational physics has been, in the past 50 years, getting more attention than ever. Recently, the first detection of gravitational waves (GW) from a Black Hole (BH) - Black Hole, Neutron star (NS) – Neutron Star and BH-NS binaries gave a boost and a new enthusiasm to this study field. These new ways of studying the Universe not only allows the mapping of these compact objects but also opens a window on the detection and study of more exotic objects, like Boson Stars (BSs), which can mimic BH binaries. In my thesis I use the Einstein Toolkit framework to: evolve head-on collisions within two independent static BSs solutions; and doublet systems of dipolar BSs solutions (l=1, m=0) (both particular cases of a Q-ball solution). With these results I extract both the scalar field distribution and the l=m=2 mode of the real part of the GW signal."
SantiagoJaraba,Santiago Jaraba,Instituto de Física Teórica (UAM-CSIC),Black hole induced spins from hyperbolic encounters in dense clusters,"The black holes that have been detected via gravitational waves (GW) can have either astrophysical or primordial origin. Some GW events show significant spin for one of the components and have been assumed to be astrophysical, since primordial black holes are generated with very low spins. However, it is worth studying if they can increase their spin throughout the evolution of the universe. Possible mechanisms that have already been explored are multiple black hole mergers and gas accretion. We propose here a new mechanism that can occur in dense clusters of black holes: the spin-up of primordial black holes when they are involved in close hyperbolic encounters. We explore this effect numerically with the Einstein Toolkit for different initial conditions, including variable mass ratios. For equal masses, there is a maximum spin that can be induced on the black holes, χ=a/m≤0.2. We find however that for large mass ratios one can attain spins up to at least χ≃0.5, where the highest spin is induced on the most massive black hole. For small induced spins we provide simple analytical expressions that depend on the relative velocity and impact parameter."
ShaileshKumar,Shailesh Kumar,"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad",Displacement memory and BMS symmetries,"The direct detection of gravitational wave (GW) from binary black hole (BBH) mergers has set a strong evidence for general theory of relativity. These observations have enabled researchers to look for various aspects of black hole spacetimes; Gravitational wave memory effect (GW-memory) is one of such physical effects which has not been detected yet. The GW-memory manifests a permanent displacement in the spacetime which is a relative change in the position of freely falling LIGO test masses. It has been shown that the memory effect is related to the asymptotic symmetries of spacetimes originally discovered by Bondi-van der Berg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS). From theoretical perspectives, recovering asymptotic symmetries near the horizon of black holes has become a matter of interest to the researchers as Hawking, Perry and Strominger conjectured that the charges corresponding to BMS symmetries would help to retrieve the information in the Hawking information paradox. Therefore, memory effect must be well studied in the context of BMS symmetries from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. In this direction, my current research focuses on to investigate some of these aspects by estimating the measurable effects on the detectors after the passage of GWs. My aim would be to discuss some theoretical features of displacement memory effect near the horizon of black holes and its possible connection with near-horizon BMS symmetries.

SyedNaqvi,Syed Naqvi,"Astronomical Observatory, Jagiellonian University",Freely falling bodies in standing wave spacetime.,"The phenomena of standing waves is well known in mechanical and electromagnetic setting where the wave has the maximum and minimum amplitude at the antinodes and nodes, respectively. In context of exact solution to Einstein Field equations, we analyze a spacetime which represents standing gravitational waves in an expanding Universe.
The study the motion of free masses subject to the influence of
standing gravitational waves in the polarized Gowdy cosmology with
a three-torus topology. We show that antinodes attract freely falling
particles and we trace the velocity memory effect."
ThiagoAssumpção,Thiago Assumpção,West Virginia University,NRPyElliptic: A User-Friendly Hyperbolic Relaxation Solver for Numerical Relativity,"I will introduce NRPyElliptic, an elliptic solver built on the NRPy+ infrastructure. As its first application, it sets up conformally flat, binary puncture initial data on prolate-spheroidal-like grids. The code employs a hyperbolic relaxation scheme, whereby an elliptic equation is transformed into a hyperbolic equation. Our implementation of this scheme implements new performance optimizations that speed up the solver by orders of magnitude over the original approach. NRPyElliptic is easily extensible to other nonlinear elliptic PDEs and supports other coordinate systems as well. It has been developed as an Einstein Toolkit thorn and as a stand-alone code, both of which are documented in pedagogical Jupyter notebooks."
ThomasHelfer,Thomas Helfer,Johns Hopkins University ,Boson Star Initial data ,"We show a new way of generating initial data for binary Boson Stars, which reduces initial excitations significantly. We show that it will dramatically improve the quality of the extracted gravitational waves."
XinyuLi,Xinyu Li,CITA/PI,Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversions in Neutron-star Post-Merger Accretion Disks,"A compact accretion disk may be formed in the merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole. 
Outflows from such accretion disks have been identified as a major site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis and as the source of `red' kilonova emission following the first observed neutron-star merger GW170817. 
We present long-term general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a typical post-merger accretion disk at initial accretion rates of 1Msun/s over 400ms post-merger. 
We include neutrino radiation transport that accounts for effects of neutrino fast flavor conversions dynamically.
We find ubiquitous flavor oscillations that result in a significantly more neutron-rich outflow, providing lanthanide and 3rd-peak r-process abundances similar to solar abundances. 
This provides strong evidence that post-merger accretion disks are a major production site of heavy r-process elements. A similar flavor effect may allow for increased lanthanide production in collapsars."
